\description{
Coefficient of Variation Test
}
\details{
\code{CV.test} tests for the difference in coefficients of variations for
two variables (\code{x1} and \code{x2}), using either a variance ratio
(\emph{F}) test (default) or a \emph{Z} test.

The variance-ratio test was described by Lewontin (1966), but apparently
dates back to Wright (1952) and Bader and Lehman (1965). This test involves
a ratio of log-transformed variances, which follows an \emph{F}-distribution
with \eqn{n_{1}-1}{n1-1} and \eqn{n_{2}-1}{n2-1} degrees of freedom.

Miller (1991) describes a \emph{Z} test that does not involve a
log-transformation, provided that the data are positive and normally
distributed. The \emph{Z} test performs best if the coefficients of
variation are less than 0.33.
